# Introduction
CS 430 Project 3: Recursive Ray Tracing
This Project is supposed to raycast basic shapes to a scene, along
with lights to create lighing and shadows on the objects, and reflection
and refraction.

# Usage
takes 4 arguments:
1: The width of the scene greater than 0
2: the Height of the scene greater than 0
3: The input file (Doesn't change anything)
4: The output file (I've been using .data instead of .ppm, because I haven't
                    been able to write to ppm)
